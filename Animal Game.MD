### Purpose - Use a decision tree to play the Animal Game

### Intro
The Animal Game program uses a decision tree for guessing the animal that the player is thinking of based on the player's answers to a series of questions. The game should start by asking the question in the root node, then follow the answer to the next node, ask the question in that node, and work down tree until it gets to a leaf node. The leaf node will contain the name of an animal which will be the program's guess.

### Details 
Given an incomplete implementation of the Animal Game game I implemented the additional functions.
+ Able to ask questions and guess answers
+ Able to extend the tree with yes/no questions 
+ Able to print the decision tree
+ Able to draw the decsision tree
